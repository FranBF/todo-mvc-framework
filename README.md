# ToDo App (By Fran Benages)
## Installation

- First, you have to clone the github code provided in the email.
- Next, run composer install to install all of the dependencies
- Copy the .env.example and create a new .env file and modify all of the DB information in order to run a DbConnection
- Run php -S localhost:8080 to run the server (previously you need to up apache service and mysql service for the app to work)
- To run the migrations, use php migrations.php

If you have any error or problem running the app, contact me and we'll take a look.
